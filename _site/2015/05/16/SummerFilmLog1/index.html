<p>Summer is usually the only time of the year when I have a significant amount of
free time. A 40 hour work week feels like nothing compared to the constant
onslaught of assignments, projects, and tests that entail the school year.
So, one of the things I've set out to do with all this extra time is watch
more films. There isn't any specific theme or genre I'm trying to explore, but
rather I just want to expose myself to more film.</p>
