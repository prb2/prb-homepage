<div class="subtitle">OMPL Web Application</div>
The OMPL web app is a front end for motion planning and benchmarking using the
Open Motion Planning Library. Users can configure and solve motion planning
problems using 3D models of robots and environments as well as visualize
solution paths. It also has the ability to benchmark planning algorithms,
allowing users to compare performance across different types of problems and
pick the best planner for their needs.

<div class="subtitle">Metabolic Pathway Visualization</div>
A web front end for visualizing metabolic pathways. Users have the ability to
interact with the
visualization, view compound and reaction information, and filter pathways.

This demo is a work in progress. It will take a while to load and is
unstable. Demo: </br>
