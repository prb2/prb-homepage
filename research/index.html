<div class="subtitle">OMPL Web Application</div>
    The OMPL web app is a front end for motion planning and benchmarking using the
    Open Motion Planning Library. Users can configure and solve motion planning
    problems using 3D models of robots and environments as well as visualize
    solution paths. It also has the ability to benchmark planning algorithms,
    allowing users to compare performance across different types of problems and
    pick the best planner for their needs.

<div class="subtitle">Metabolic Pathway Search & Visualization</div>
    I am currently in the process of researching and developing an algorithm for
    finding biologically meaningful pathways in metabolic networks. The goal is to find pathways in a graph of
    metabolic reactions that conserve a given number of carbon atoms from start to
    goal. Pathways which conserve a high percentage of atoms from the start to goal
    compounds will be biologically relevant. So, by tracking atoms, we are more
    likely to find metabolic pathways of biological importance. The movement of
    atoms through the pathway's reactions is modeled as the movement of flow through
    a directed graph. Applications for this work include metabolic engineering, as
    well as more general flow movement problems.

    In addition to the path finding algorithm, I am also developing a web front
    end for visualizing metabolic pathways. Users have the ability to interact with
    the visualization, view compound and reaction information, and filter pathways.
